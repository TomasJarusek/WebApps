# WebApps

Collection of my JavaScript and C++ projects.
This repository is hosted at my website https://tomasjarusek.cz/.

## Description

### JavaScript projects
* Web demos about anything that interests me at the moment. They are meant to help visualize concepts from math, physics and computer science in a fun and interactive way. They are implemented in HTML/CSS/JavaScript, use \<canvas\> element for drawing and run purely on client side.

### C++ projects
* Short descriptions/demonstrations of my offline C++/OpenGL projects that I implemented. Mostly data structures that I am hoping to use one day to make a RTS videogame from scratch.

### Dependencies, Installing and Executing

* Web demos run purely on client side and require no dependencies. After downloading the repository, they can be run by opening corresponding index.html file in a web browser.
* C++ code is private as of now.
