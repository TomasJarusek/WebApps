			Point Quadtree

			<br>
			<div class="highlight">Features of my implementation:</div><br>
			<div class="subDescription">
			• Arbitrary limit for number of points in leaf quadrants.<br><br>
			• Dedicated implementation of point relocation. Relocation is always possible to simulate via deletion and reinsertion of a point. However, such process is quite inefficient. My implementation uses two approaches to speed up the process:<br><br>
				<div class="subDescription">
				- Memory recycling - quadtree uses internal structures that have to be allocated/freed when new point is inserted/deleted. So for relocation, pointers to already allocated memory are stored and reused.<br><br>
				- Bottom up searching for new leaf subtree - when points are relocated, the new location is usually not far from the original location and this can be exploited. If the point is still located in the same leaf quadrant after relocation, it is only necessary to change its coordinates (quadtree structure stays the same). If it moved over the quadrant boundary, the new position is most likely going to be in a subtree with the same parent or grandparent. So from the leaf subtree that the point is located in, the function starts moving upwards and in each parent, it checks whether or not the point belongs to the subregion of that subtree. If yes, then the point is inserted into it. This means that only a fraction of the whole quadtree has to be searched.<br><br>
				</div>
			This results in order of magnitude speed up over the naive deletion/insertion approach.
